# Nigeria-Enhancing-Maternal-Health
* Nigeria's maternal mortality ratio is extremely high with over 1000 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.
* This analysis is a part of Omdena local chapter Enhancing Maternal Health machine learning project.
* According to the World Health Organization, the high number of maternal deaths in some areas of the world reflects inequalities in access to quality health services and highlights the gap between rich and poor (World Health Organization, 2023, February 22). At a glance at the dataset, Nigeria seems to have a wealth gap between urban and rural areas. This analysis focuses on the differences between rural and urban areas, regions as well as states.
